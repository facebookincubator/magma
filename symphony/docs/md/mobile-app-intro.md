If you see a warning about installing apps from Unknown Sources, you have to provide permission.  Depending on the version of Android, you can do this by navigating to the right menu:

Oreo and above:
1. Open **Settings**
2. Select **Apps & notifications**
3. Select **Special app access**
4. Select **Install unknown apps**

Below Oreo:
1. Open **Settings**
2. Select **Security**
3. Check the option **"Unknown sources"**
4. Select **"Trust"**


## Login
Login to the app using the same username/password that are used for the web UI.  Use the subdomain of this site for the `Tenant` field.  For example, if this page is at https://testing.example.com use `testing` for the Tenant name.
